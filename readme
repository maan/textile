This project intends to glue the Textile markup language (v2.0.0) with an Tk text widget (Tk 8.5) and a browser (tested with Firefox 3.5.2) with Tcl (Tools Command Language).

Textile is implemented in Textpattern and is very convenient in use. But is not necessary just for personal documentation purposes to use a whole CMS. So we take an simple text editor and enable it to produce Html Code. A browser will present immediately the web page. Tcl will glue all the well tested parts together.
