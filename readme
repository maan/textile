This project intends to glue the Textile markup language (v2.0.0) with an Tk text widget (Tk 8.5) in order to create Html code.

Textile is implemented in Textpattern and is very convenient in use. But is not necessary just for personal website to use a complete CMS. So we take an simple text editor and enable it to produce Html Code. A browser will present immediately the web page. Tcl will glue all the well tested parts together.

Why Textile? Compared to Markdown it is able to integrate Html and CSS code smoothly, e.g.

p(myClass). This is text.
p(#myId). This is text
